\chapter{Abstract}

\begin{english}

During the last two and a half years, we all had to deal with statistics, virology and the term effectiveness. A lot of different opinions and conceptions are existing around this term, yet not many people could explain it. The goal of this work is to explain and illustrate the term effectiveness but also to find an answer for the often asked question, which actions and vaccination strategies worked out.

For this, data from different sources was used and compared, and it was investigated if there is a correlation in this data. It was found that both vaccinations and stringency strongly correlated to cases and death numbers.

In the course of this work, an online survey of 425 people was conducted to find out which motives and opinions are actually out there. The results showed that people think differently whether the vaccination is effective or not depending on their own vaccination status and their take on vaccinations, education showed no impact.
